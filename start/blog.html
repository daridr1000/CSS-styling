   <h3>My To-Do List</h3> 
   <ul>
      <li>Test out the Typography and Flow of HTML elements</li>
      <li>Take a nap</li>
      <li>Keep coding!</li>
      <li><a href="https://covalence.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can also add hyperlinks inside of other elements! Like this. Since we used the "target" attribute with the value "_blank", the website will open in a new tab or window. Remember to use the "rel" attribute as well for security concerns!</a></li>
           <h3>Article heading.</h3>
           <p>Article text.</p>
        </article>
        <section>
           <!-- div elements are just dividers. They do not have any semantic meaning, but they are commonly used in HTML - often as wrappers to contain other elements or sections in your code. -->
           <div class="container"></div>
        </section>
     </main>
     <footer>
        The footer commonly contains sitemaps (links to the main pages of your website), copyright and privacy policy notices, and more. This is information that is useful to access on all of the pages on the website.
